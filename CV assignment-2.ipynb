    "ans:A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a type of artificial neural network used in image recognition and processing that is specifically designed to process pixel data. CNNs use a combination of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers to identify patterns in the data. Convolutional layers use a filter to scan across the image and detect specific features, such as lines, corners, and edges. Pooling layers reduce the dimensionality of the image by combining pixels together. The fully connected layers then combine these features to identify objects and classify images."

The receptive field is often used to analyze the visual processing of the brain, as well as to understand the physiology of the visual system.
